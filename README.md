# AlexFakeVacation Web Application 
NodeJS Learning and Education!


Note web application has not had bootstrap applied yet to the webpages so they look pretty bland...but yea easy to add. (Will add after i complete the whole project)


This is not a REAL project that I am working on, its mostly just to tune up on my NodeJS Skills.
Play around with various protocols and methods of launching web applications. This may or may not be fully completed, depending where the industry takes me. 


Just a tutorial i will be updating every little while, the real application is in app.js 

Views provide websites (that are shown to user)

Views provide the actual website, so that it allows it to be Dynamic and allow testing. [ Still not completed ]
